# Inspiration/Purpose
I know Awesome Piracy and FMHY already exists but I like to collect. I had my tg channel and discord server where I use to share my collections. But over the years due to lack of time I am unable to share much so decided to batch up all my collections and make yet another index as farewell gift. I am not sure whether I will be able to maintain it(I will try to maintain) so feel free to fork and continue it.
